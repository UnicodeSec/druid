# Segment Size Optimization

In Druid, it's important to optimize the segment size because

  1. Druid stores data in segments. If you're using the [best-effort roll-up](../design/index.html#roll-up-modes) mode,
  increasing the segment size might introduce further aggregation which reduces the dataSource size.
  2. When a query is submitted, that query is distributed to all Historicals and realtimes
  which hold the input segments of the query. Each node has a processing threads pool and use one thread per segment to
  process it. If the segment size is too large, data might not be well distributed over the
  whole cluster, thereby decreasing the degree of parallelism. If the segment size is too small,
  each processing thread might process too small data. This can reduce the overall processing speed because
  parallel processing involves some overhead like thread scheduling.

It would be best if you can optimize the segment size at ingestion time, but sometimes it's not easy
especially when it comes to stream ingestion because the amount of data ingested might vary over time. In this case,
you can create segments with a sub-optimzed size first and optimize them later.

There might be several ways to check if the compaction is necessary. One way
is using the [System Schema](../querying/sql.html#system-schema). The
system schema provides several tables about the current system status including the `segments` table.
By running the below query, you can get the average number of rows and average size for published segments.

```sql
SELECT
  "start",
  "end",
  version,
  COUNT(*) AS num_segments,
  AVG("num_rows") AS avg_num_rows,
  SUM("num_rows") AS total_num_rows,
  AVG("size") AS avg_size,
  SUM("size") AS total_size
FROM
  sys.segments A
WHERE
  datasource = 'your_dataSource' AND
  is_published = 1
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3 DESC;
```

Please note that the query result might include overshadowed segments.
In this case, you may want to see only rows of the max version per interval (pair of `start` and `end`).

The recomended number of rows per segment and segment size are 5 million rows and 300 ~ 700MB, respectively.
If you see way different numbers, you may need to compact your segments.

<div class="note">
The above values are generally good for most use cases, but the optimal
values can vary based on your workload. For example, if most of your queries
are heavy and take a long time to process each row, you may want to make
segments smaller so that the query processing can be more parallelized.
</div>

You have two options for segment compaction:

  - Turning on the [automatic compaction of Coordinators](../design/coordinator.html#compacting-segments).
  The Coordinator periodically submits [compaction tasks](../ingestion/tasks.html#compaction-task) to re-index small segments.
  To enable the automatic compaction, you need to configure it for each dataSource via Coordinator's dynamic configuration.
  See [Compaction Configuration API](../operations/api-reference.html#compaction-configuration)
  and [Compaction Configuration](../configuration/index.html#compaction-dynamic-configuration) for details.
  - Running periodic Hadoop batch ingestion jobs and using a `dataSource`
  inputSpec to read from the segments generated by the Kafka indexing tasks. This might be helpful if you want to compact a lot of segments in parallel.
  Details on how to do this can be found under ['Updating Existing Data'](../ingestion/update-existing-data.html).
